description: Evaluate and improve note titles and implicit claims. First decide claim vs resource, then apply the appropriate rubric. Use when naming or renaming notes, identifying the claim inside a note, or checking whether a title captures the real assertion.

# Claim Rubric

Use this rubric when titling any note. The first question is always: **is this a claim or a resource?**

Use it before or alongside `note-interrogation` when the claim is fuzzy. `claim-rubric` identifies and names the assertion; `note-interrogation` reconstructs the argument before critique.

## Step 1: Claim or Resource?

- **Claim** — an assertion. The note argues something, synthesizes a position, or captures someone's thesis. The title is a sentence you could agree or disagree with.
- **Resource** — a pointer to a thing. A tool, a person's article, a methodology, a dataset. The title names what it is, not what it argues.

This applies across the whole vault — both `raw/` and `wiki/`. It's not tied to any directory.

## Step 2a: Claim titles (5 checks)

A strong claim title should pass at least 4/5.

1. **Specific assertion** — State a concrete assertion, not a generic topic label.
2. **Debatable** — Something a smart person could reasonably disagree with.
3. **Standalone** — Still makes sense when inlined in a wikilink sentence.
4. **Scope-bounded** — Has a clear boundary; avoids "everything about X."
5. **Useful for action** — Implies what to do, what to test, or what to pay attention to.

### Rewrite pattern

When a title fails 4/5:
- Replace broad labels (`Thoughts on X`, `X notes`, `X system`) with a testable statement.
- Keep the shortest phrasing that preserves the claim.
- Prefer active wording over abstract nouns.

### Claim examples

- Weak: `Thoughts on quality` / Strong: `Quality is the hard part`
- Weak: `AI note-taking` / Strong: `Most AI note-taking fails at retrieval, not capture`
- Weak: `Thread by @someone` / Strong: `Agent Harness is the Real Product`

## Step 2b: Resource titles

Use the pattern `Thing — What it does` or just the proper name.

- Tools: `Fieldtheory CLI — X bookmark sync for agents`
- Articles: `Karri Saarinen - The disappearing middle of software work`
- Concepts/entities: `Context Engineering`, `Cholesterol`
- People: `George Hotz`, `Kepano`

### Resource examples

- Weak: `Thread by @andrewfarah` / Strong: `Fieldtheory CLI — X bookmark sync for agents`
- Weak: `Interesting article about strategy` / Strong: `Stripe's 2026 Annual Letter — What It Means for Vana`

## Exceptions

Use question titles when uncertainty is the point:
- `What would falsify X?`
